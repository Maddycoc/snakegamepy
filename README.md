# Snake Game Via Python Turtle


The classic snake game is back from the 1900's by our all time favourite "Python Turtle".
The main aim of the game is to capture red blocks(consider them as apples) as much as possible.
The code is of total 163 lines, which is divided well with #es.
I hope you will like the code well.
